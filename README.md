# MorpionOneLine
## main.py
This Python program is a "Tic Tac Toe" or "Morpion" in one line in Python in a Pythonic way without `exec` or `eval`.
That means, that I don't use ";" or "{".
But you can use them.
Example:
```py
globals().__setitem__("p",print) # Long but Pythonic
p=print # Short but not Pythonic
```
Length: 700chars

## main_in_lines.py
This Python program is the "equivalent" of the main.py but in many lines and readable.
So you can understand how it works
